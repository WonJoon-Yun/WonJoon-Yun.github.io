## Summary
   I always try to expose myself to a new environment, endeavouring to learn and feel new things. The excitement of learning through new experiences of every moment gives me a power to overcome every challenge that I face. I constantly record and organize things I have learned or felt every moment, and constantly look back at myself to be more advanced than yesterday.
